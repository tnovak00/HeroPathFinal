<h2>A Hero's Path</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You play as the blossoming soon-to-be hero, Egeiro, in an action/adventure game, who must journey, meet, fight and befriend gods and monsters to save his Greek village.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player should be able to experience control over the game's story and outcome. The player will also feel at first that they are not very strong, but will grow more powerful over time just like Egeiro in the story does.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Action/adventure
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player controls Egeiro as he battles his way through multiple platformming levels, attack monsters and gathering items. At the end of each level, the player must fight against a boss who can either be killed or befriended if the player makes the right dialogue choices or uses the correct items.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Using a variety of different kinds of gameplay to give the player and exciting and new experience. The prototype has one level currently which gives a good example of how the game will be played throughout platformming levels, item collection and turn-based battles with dialogue.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
A Hero's Path combines gameplay types from different kinds of genres of game to give a whole new type of experience. A Hero's Path also gives the player choices that change the way the game is played throughout levels and allows for different endings to the story.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game takes place in ancient Greece in a time where gods and mortals intermingled and heros rose from tiny villages dotting the Mediterranean.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Egeiro, a boy who grew up in a small village in Greece, is visted in a dream by a goddess who tells him that his world is in grave danger. In order to save his village and the people he loves he must journey across the land to Mt. Olympus, home of the gods, and become a hero.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Young adults and those interested in classic mythology.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
20-30 minutes (with all levels). With one level, about 8-10 minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
It's important to look for chests in the platformming levels and secret places where important items may hide before entering the lair of the boss. When fighting the boss, consider the items you have and all your options before deciding to go all out and attack.
</li>
    
<li><strong>Estimated Schedule:</strong>
My hope is that this game would be able to be finished in a couple of weeks with a team of at least three people coding levels, finding assets, and making the tilemaps necessary. The basic code for the dialogue system, turn-based battling and controls has been finished so all that is needed to do is work on the final levels, inventory management, and level system.
</li>
    
<li><strong>Team:</strong>
While I have good skills in time management and communication, my team would need members who have skills in art design and the ability to think outside the box. I am somewhat knowledgeable in Phaser especially in the realm of creating platformers, but still in the beginning stages of learning to use it. Team members working on A Hero’s Path would be encouraged to have an interest in using Phaser in a creative way and have experience in making RPG elements in Phaser such as in-game menus, turn-based battles and dialogue branching. I’m also looking for writing skills in potential teammates.
